    "\n",
    "- A majority of loans are currently performing well, with a significant portion successfully completed.\n",
    "- California and Texas dominate the borrower base, while other states have significantly lower participation.\n",
    "- Borrower income is a key driver of loan amounts, with higher-income borrowers tending to take larger loans.\n",
    "- Credit scores vary significantly across employment types, with employed and full-time borrowers generally exhibiting higher scores.\n",
    "- Students, particularly those attending community colleges, are more likely to be employed than those in technical schools whom they took a loan with Prosper.\n",
    "- Loan terms influence loan amounts, with longer terms associated with larger loans.\n",
    "- The loan market has seen increasing loan amounts over time, with a notable spike in 2009.\n",
    "- Investor participation correlates with monthly loan payments, indicating a relationship between loan size and investor involvement.\n",
    "- Outliers in investor count and monthly payments suggest potential high-value or complex loan structures.\n",
    "- Borrower APR is negatively correlated with credit score, indicating a reward for good credit.\n",
    "- Loan original amount and stated monthly income exhibit a moderate positive correlation, suggesting income as a key factor in borrowing capacity."
